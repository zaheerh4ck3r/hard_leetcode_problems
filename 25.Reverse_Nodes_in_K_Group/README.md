**Step-by-Step Process for Reversing a Linked List in Groups of k Nodes** **Step 1: Set Up the Problem** 
You have a linked list and you want to reverse it in groups of k nodes. To achieve this, you'll use two main functions: `reverseKGroup` and `reverseLinkedList`.**Initial Linked List** 
Assume your linked list is:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
with k = 2.
**Step 2: Create a Dummy Node** 
Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases. This node doesn’t hold any list value but acts as a placeholder at the beginning.

```python
dummy = ListNode(0)
dummy.next = head  # Dummy node points to the head of the list
```
**Visual Aid:** 
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Here, dummy points to the original head of the list.
Step 3: Set Up the `prev` Pointer** 
Initialize the `prev` pointer to the dummy node. This will help connect the reversed segments back to the main list.

```python
prev = dummy
```
**Visual Aid:** 
prev(dummy) -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5The `prev` pointer now points to the dummy node at the start of the list.**Step 4: Find the Tail of the First Segment** 
Locate the tail of the first segment of k nodes by moving the `tail` pointer forward by k nodes.

```python
tail = prev
for i in range(k):
    tail = tail.next
    if not tail:
        return dummy.next  # Return the list if fewer than k nodes are left
```
**Visual Aid:** 
prev(dummy) -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

head tailAfter the loop, `tail` points to the 2nd node, and `head` (to be reversed) starts at node 1.Difference Between `reverseKGroup` and `reverseLinkedList`**  
- **`reverseKGroup`:**  
  - **Purpose:**  Reverses the entire linked list in chunks of k nodes and calls `reverseLinkedList` for each group.
 
  - **Role:**  Acts as the "main controller" for reversing multiple groups and maintaining correct connections.
 
- **`reverseLinkedList`:**  
  - **Purpose:**  Reverses a specific segment of the linked list from a given head to tail.
 
  - **Role:**  Handles the actual reversal of nodes within the segment.
**Analogy:**  
- **`reverseKGroup`**  is like a librarian deciding which books (groups of nodes) to rearrange.
 
- **`reverseLinkedList`**  is like the librarian’s assistant who physically rearranges the pages (nodes) within each book (group).
Why Use the `prev` Node?**  
- **Purpose:**  Keeps track of the node immediately before the current group of k nodes to reconnect the reversed segment.
 
- **Role:**  
  - After reversing a group, the `prev` pointer ensures the new segment connects correctly to the previous part of the list.
**Example:** 
For the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6` and `k = 2`: 
1. After reversing the first 2 nodes (1 and 2): `2 -> 1`.
 
2. Update `prev` to connect to 2, the new head of the reversed group.
 
3. The list becomes: `dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`.
 
4. Move `prev` to the last node of the reversed group (1) for the next reversal.
**Visual Aid:** 
**Before Reversal:** 
prev -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6**After Reversal:** 
dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

prev (new head after reversal)**Detailed Implementation** **Step 1: Initial Setup** 

```python
dummy = ListNode(0)
dummy.next = head
prev = dummy
```
 
- **Dummy Node:**  Simplifies edge cases like changing the head of the list.
 
- **Prev Node:**  Points to the dummy node, crucial for linking reversed segments.
**Visual Aid:** 
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
↑
prev**Step 2: Identify the Group to Reverse** 

```python
while True:
    tail = prev
    for i in range(k):
        tail = tail.next
        if not tail:
            return dummy.next
```
 
- **Finding the k-th Node:**  Moves `tail` forward by k nodes. If fewer than k nodes are left, return the modified list.
**Visual Aid:** 
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
↑ ↑
prev tail**Step 3: Reverse the Group** 

```python
nxt = tail.next
head, tail = reverseLinkedList(prev.next, tail)
prev.next = head
tail.next = nxt
prev = tail
```
 
1. **Save the Next Node:**  `nxt` stores the node after the reversed segment.
 
2. **Reverse the Segment:**  Uses `reverseLinkedList` to reverse nodes from `prev.next` to `tail`.
 
3. **Reconnect the Reversed Segment:**  `prev.next` connects to the new head of the reversed segment, and `tail.next` connects to `nxt`.
 
4. **Move prev Forward:**  Update `prev` to `tail` for the next segment.
**Visual Aid:** 
**Before Reversal:** 
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
↑
tail**After Reversal:** 
dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
↑
tail**Summary:**  
1. **Save the Next Node:**  `nxt` is used to reconnect after reversal.
 
2. **Reverse the Segment:**  Reverse the k nodes.
 
3. **Reconnect:**  Link the reversed segment back to the list.
 
4. **Update prev:**  Move `prev` to prepare for the next segment.
**Step 4: Loop Continuation and Completion** 
Continue processing the list in a loop until no full group of k nodes is left.

```python
while True:
    tail = prev
    for i in range(k):
        tail = tail.next
        if not tail:
            return dummy.next
        
    nxt = tail.next
    head, tail = reverseLinkedList(prev.next, tail)
    prev.next = head
    tail.next = nxt
    prev = tail
```
 
- **Continuously Process:**  Loop processes the list until fewer than k nodes remain.
 
- **Identify Segment:**  Move `tail` by k nodes to find the segment to reverse.
 
- **Reverse Segment:**  Reverse the identified segment.
 
- **Reconnect and Update:**  Link the reversed segment back and prepare for the next group.
Understanding `reverseLinkedList`** **Function Code:** 

```python
def reverseLinkedList(head, tail):
    prev = tail.next
    p = head
    while prev != tail:
        nxt = p.next
        p.next = prev
        prev = p
        p = nxt
    return tail, head
```
**Detailed Explanation:**  
1. **Initialize Pointers:**  
  - `prev` points to `tail.next` (node after tail).
 
  - `p` points to `head` (start of the segment).
 
2. **Reversal Loop:** 
  - Iterate through the segment, reversing the link between nodes.
 
3. **Return:** 
  - Return the new head and tail of the reversed segment.
**Visual Aid:** 
**Initial:** 
head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
tail -> 4
prev -> None (tail.next)
p -> 1**Result:** 
head -> 4
tail -> 1**Final Implementation** 
Here's the full code integrating all steps:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy

        while True:
            tail = prev
            for i in range(k):
                tail = tail.next
                if not tail:
                    return dummy.next

            nxt = tail.next
            head, tail = self.reverseLinkedList(prev.next, tail)
            prev.next = head
            tail.next = nxt
            prev = tail

    def reverseLinkedList(self, head, tail):
        prev = tail.next
        p = head
        while prev != tail:
            nxt = p.next
            p.next = prev
            prev = p
            p = nxt
        return tail, head
```
